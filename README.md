# Cowboy Red (The Godot example project)
This is a project I am working on with an artist friend ([@petrifyyoursoul](https://petrifyyoursoul.carrd.co/), you already had an interview with her ;p). She's responsible for the art and animations while I'm working on the code and generally pulling everything together in Godot. We're also working together on the general story & gameplay direction.

This project is still in very early stages as it's in the process of being ported over from Unity in my free time, but it should hopefully show that I'm familiar with Godot as well as game-dev in general.

## See the Code & Run the Game
I believe that you should simply be able to import the 'godot-example-project' folder into Godot as a project, and from there be able to both view the code and play (what little there is right now of) the game. If there are any issues there, please feel welcome to reach out to me!

# Just a Cats Life (The Renpy Example Project)
This is a Python based project I worked on with a differnt artist friend. They provided all the art and dialogue, while I provided the code. We worked together on the story and gameplay direction.

## See the Code
The project code can be seen in 'renpy-example-project\Just-a-Cats-Life'.
A lot of this is effectively just Ren'Py boilerplate; if you're not sure what to look for, the especially interesting stuff can be seen in 'renpy-example-project\Just-a-Cats-Life\scripts'. I believe those files can be opened in most editors, but I know for certain they can be opened in VSCode.

## Run the Game
Simply go to 'renpy-example-project\JustACatsLife-1.0-dists', extract the version that's right for your OS, and run the exe. If you'd rather not run an exe from a random internet person (understandable) I could also show it to you over a call.
